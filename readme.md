Doing model fine tune just like ollama. 
Final goal is

## Design
- Use C / C++ for model details
- Use Go lang as much as possible for memory safety 
- Support GGUF first ?

## Todo

- [] Inference qwen0.5b model
- [] fine tune qwen0.5b model# Pardus-


## Roadmap
- [] we use tiny llama as an experiment finish whole workflow once
